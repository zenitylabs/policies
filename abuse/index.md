# Use Restrictions

*Last updated: November 16, 2023*

## Restricted purposes

* **Spamming**: No one wants unsolicited commercial emails. We don’t tolerate folks Zenity Labs products for spamming purposes. If your emails don’t pass muster with [CAN-SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) or any other anti-spam law, it’s not allowed. If your messages are likely to be unsolicited or unwanted in any way, they are not allowed.

These restrictions are not exhaustive — it’s possible an offense could defy categorization, present for the first time, or illuminate a moral quandary we hadn’t yet considered. That said, we hope the overarching spirit is clear: Zenity Labs is not to be harnessed for harm, whether mental, physical, personal or civic. Different points of view — philosophical, religious, and political — are welcome, but ideologies like white nationalism, or hate-fueled movements anchored by oppression, violence, abuse, extermination, or domination of one group over another, will not be accepted here.

## How to report abuse

For cases of suspected malware, spyware, phishing, spamming, and cybersquatting, please alert us at [abuse@zenitylabs.com](mailto:abuse@zenitylabs.com).

For all other cases, please let us know by emailing [report@zenitylabs.com](mailto:report@zenitylabs.com). If you’re not 100% sure if something rises to the level of our use restrictions policy, report it anyway.

Please share as much as you are comfortable with about the account, the content or behavior you are reporting, and how you found it. Sending us a URL or screenshots is super helpful. If you need a secure file transfer, let us know and we will send you a link. We will not disclose your identity to anyone associated with the reported account. For copyright cases, we've outlined extra instructions on [how to notify us about infringement claims](../copyright/index.md).

Someone on our team will respond within one business day to let you know we’ve begun investigating. We have published details on [how we investigate use restriction reports](how-we-handle/index.md). We will also let you know the outcome of our investigation (unless you ask us not to, or we are not allowed to under law).

**This policy and process applies to any product created and owned by Zenity Labs, LLC. That includes: Bench.*
