# Bench subprocessors

*Last updated: November 16, 2023*

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Bench (the service). We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

* [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/gdpr/). Transactional email service.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa). Billing and payment processing. 
* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/gdpr). Transactional messaging service.

If you want to be notified every time we update this list, subscribe to our [Policies repository](https://github.com/zenitylabs/policies/tree/master/privacy) on GitHub. [Here's how](../../updates/index.md).
