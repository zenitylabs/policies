# Sign up to receive update notifications

You can subscribe to activity notifications to know when our policies change. Here's how:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign in with your account. You can create a free account if you don't have one.
2. Visit our Policies repository at [https://github.com/zenitylabs/policies](https://github.com/zenitylabs/policies).
3. Click the "Watch" button in the top-right corner of the page.
4. Choose the notification settings you want. If you want to keep things simple, just select "All Activity."
