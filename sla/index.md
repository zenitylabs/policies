# Zenity Labs SLA

Zenity Labs is a small software shop with limited capacity. Despite that, it is always our goal to keep our services available 99.9% of the time. If we fail to do so, paying customers receive a refund for the time we are unavailable. 

## What is “uptime”?

“Uptime” refers to the period of time when Zenity Labs services are up and running.

## What happens if it’s below 99.99%?

Stuff happens, so if our uptime drops below 99.9%, we will provide a credit to customers who request one. Our goal is to make credits automatic, no-questions-asked. Doing so requires systems that we don't yet have in place. 

## How do we track that uptime?

We track uptime internally, but we plan to make uptime data publicly available in the future. 

## Will this change in the future?

Zenity Labs may update this SLA once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site.

## What if I have questions about this SLA?

Please get in touch with [support][support@zenitylabs.com] and we’ll be happy to answer them!
